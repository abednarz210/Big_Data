He was caught between that proverbial rock  and  a hard place and was forced to make an impossibly tough choice. But, just like in a tennis match, in order for Callum to win in Love, he had to put himself out there, face his opponent head on with everything he had, and fight to win.

And while reading it, one can certainly see the genesis of the show in his hilariously awkward childhood. Since Mr. Feig and I must be about the same age, this was a trip down memory lane, both in terms of the childhood experiences and the pop cultural references.  This entertaining and neurotic memoir could probably be read in a single evening, but why rush it?  I found myself delayed by frequent laughing jags followed by moments of reverie as I daydreamed of incidents from my own long ago youth.  I found the stories from the junior high years to be absolutely hysterical while those from the high school years were a bit more ponderous. But overall, well done and great fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |2012-05-01 |\n",

It is a quick read but you definitely have to be open minded to read this.  I enjoyed it and thought it was a unique storyline.<br /><br />I could relate to the characters especially at the beginning of the book and right from the start I was hooked.  I loved how the story progressed and thought it was a fun read.  We all want someone in our lives who wants to provide us with what we want (whatever that may be!! ;-)).<br /><br />It is very much a fantasy romance book without being paranormal.  It takes us on a journey from normality to something a lot more exciting with all Wendy's desires being fulfilled.  This isn't the type book I would character cast because I didn't get a feel for what the characters looked like....to me they could be any average married couple.  I think that is one the reasons the book was so appealing to me.<br /><br />I am rating this book 4 stars because it had me hooked from the start and I didn't want to put it down.  I wasn't, however, invested nearly as much with these characters as I have been with other books I've read recently.<br /><br />I thought it was interesting, enjoyable and a fun read.  I would recommend this book to people who want some happy excitement in their reading without it being too heavy!<br /><br />You can see my full blog entry about this book at Bec's Book Blog.|2013-07-22 |\n",

I was skeptical at first, but within the first 3 chapters, I couldn't put it down.  I fell in love with the characters and was sucked into the story.  I did notice a few grammatical errors and what I would call \\\\\"typos\\\\\", but I could always figure out what was meant to be said.  I thought it was better than the Twilight series and am letting my 11-year-old daughter read it now.

Husk is horror along the lines of What the Night Knows: A Novel by Dean Koontz. I enjoyed this terror novel very much. Yes, the entity is supernatural, and \\\\\"it\\\\\" makes for one VERY weird sick puppy of a killer. Maybe it is not fair to compare Hults to Koontz or early King, but he writes along those lines with his own take on horror/terror. The second part of this thriller just seemed to fly by.  One suspenseful moment was followed by another and then another an so on.  I could not find a safe place to take a break. I was planning on buying Husk anyways, but it was a bonus to get it for free.  Speaking of free, I also downloaded [[ASIN:B004NIFOEM Anything Can Be Dangerous]] by Matt Hults, and will be looking for more titles by him (and his publisher as well).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |2011-05-26 |\n",
